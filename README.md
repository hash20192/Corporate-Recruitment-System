Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science & Enigneering last semester project in JAVA2EE (around the year 2014).

Goals of the Project
1. Create a job recruitment portal that can bridge the gap between Employers and Job seekers.

3. Use standard design patterns to implement the structure.
4. Learn the effects of scope creeping and development constraints. 

Project Information
I have used Java2EE for my project with mySql at backend. All the template design are build from ground zero. I have used many javascript libraries such as jquery, jquery-magnific-popup, notify, rhinoslider in the project. The design patterns I have impleted are combination of MVC (Model View Controller) and DAO (Data Access Object). At the start, I made simple job posting website and then moved to more complex stuff such as inter-messaging and online mock test features.
